# Second Milestone
My second milestone was to get the obstacle avoidance working. I made a simple program that would move forward if there was no obstacle in front of it, and if there was, it would turn to the righ. The main issue I ran into was that it would not detect obstacles that didn't touch the ground but were just above the ultrasonic. Other than that, it worked flawlessly, even with thin obstacles. 

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting the ultrasonic sensor working and allowing it to detect any obstacle, even if it was thin. To do so, I mounted it on a servo with 3d printed parts that were secure enough so it wouldn't move even though it was secured with tape. I also assembled the chassis and got all the electronics wired up, including the motor driver and all 4 motors. I also made a test program where the robot would only move if there was no obstacle in front of it.
