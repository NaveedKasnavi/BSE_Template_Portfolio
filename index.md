# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting the ultrasonic sensor working and allowing it to detect any obstacle, even if it was thin. To do so, I mounted it on a servo with 3d printed parts that were secure enough so it wouldn't move even though it was secured with tape. I also assembled the chassis and got all the electronics wired up, including the motor driver and all 4 motors. I also made a test program where the robot would only move if there was no obstacle in front of it.
